Multi-level Subdomains:

Main Domain: example.com
Second-Level Subdomain: abcd.example.com
Third-Level Subdomain: blog.abcd.example.com

In this setup, abcd is a subdomain of example.com, and blog is a 
subdomain of abcd.example.com. You can create as many levels of 
subdomains as needed, though it's important to manage them properly for 
clarity and maintainability.

Example Scenario:
Main Domain: example.com (main website)

Subdomain: abcd.example.com (a specific section or service)

Multi-level Subdomain: blog.abcd.example.com (a blog section within abcd)
