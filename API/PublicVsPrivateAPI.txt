Public APIs:-----------

Accessibility:
Public APIs are available to external developers and third-party users.
They are often documented and published for public use.

Use Case:
Enable third-party developers to integrate with a service.
Encourage innovation by allowing developers to build on top of the platform.

Examples:
Google Maps API
Twitter API
OpenWeatherMap API

Security:
Public APIs require robust security measures, such as authentication and rate limiting, to prevent misuse.

Monetization:
Public APIs can be monetized through subscription plans, usage fees, or freemium models.

Private APIs:-------------

Accessibility:
Private APIs are restricted to internal use within an organization.
Access is limited to authorized developers and applications.

Use Case:
Facilitate communication between internal systems and services.
Improve productivity and streamline workflows within the organization.

Examples:
Internal inventory management API
Employee information API
Internal microservices API

Security:
Private APIs also require strong security measures, but access control is typically managed internally.

Monetization:
Private APIs are not monetized as they are used internally.

Summary:----------
Public APIs are designed for external use, promoting integration and innovation, and often require extensive security measures.

Private APIs are meant for internal use, facilitating internal communication and workflows within an organization, with access control managed internally.
