1. validation testing -> it ensures that the API is returning the expected 
   results and in correct format.

2. Load testing -> it involves testing the API's preformance and stability under
   stressful conditions.

3. security testing -> it aims to identify security-level vulnarabilities and 
   flaws in API.

4. penetration testing -> it involves simulating attacks from hackers to detect
   vulnarabilities and weakness in API.

5. Fuzz testing -> it involves feeding unexpected & invalid inputs into api to
   test its ability to handle unexpected input and recover from errors.

6. integration texting -> it ensures integration of all the API's is correct.

7. regression testing -> it ensures that the API is still functional after an update
   or fixing a bug.

8. UI testing -> ensures UI is using the api's correctly.
