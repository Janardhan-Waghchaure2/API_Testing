1. how to define api details in Rest Assured Automation
   -> API details are defined in given() , when() , then() methods.

2. what is JSON serialization & deserialization in RestAssured.
    serialization -> converting Java object into payloads.
    deserialization -> payloads to Java object.

3. what are common json parsing techniques in RestAssured?
   -> serialization & deserialization.

4. how to send attachments to API using RestAssured test?
   -> using Multipart method.

5. what is API testing? -> making sure api is behaving in an expected way.
   i.e validating if response(headers and body) is correct for given 
   CORRECT request.

6. is it possible to have body for GET request?
   -> Technically, it is possible to send a request body with a GET 
   request, but it's not a standard practice and is generally discouraged.

7. why doesn't the HTTP GET Request use a body?
   1. HTTP sepcification don't allow to do so.
   2. Guaranteed Idenpotency: i.e each request woud just return some data and
      wont cause any server/DB state changes on each request.
   3. implementing the cache: advantage of not having any data in request 
      body is that the results can be cached.
   4. if the get requests are getting logged into system then storing some
      body's data containing users personal info. could be issue.
