There are several ways to incorporate versioning into your API's URI. 
Here are a few common approaches, along with examples:

1. Version in the URL Path:
   https://api.example.com/v1/users
   https://api.example.com/v2/users

2. Version as a Query Parameter:
   https://api.example.com/users?version=1
   https://api.example.com/users?version=2

3. Version in the Header:
   GET https://api.example.com/users
   Headers: 
     Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json
-------
   GET https://api.example.com/users
   Headers: 
      Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json

4. Version in the Subdomain:
   https://v1.api.example.com/users
   https://v2.api.example.com/users

Considerations-------

URL Path Versioning is the most common and intuitive method, making it clear 
which version of the API is being accessed.

Query Parameter Versioning is less common but can be useful for specific cases.

Header Versioning is useful for keeping URIs clean but may not be as 
immediately visible as path versioning.

Subdomain Versioning can be useful for large-scale APIs with significant 
differences between versions.
