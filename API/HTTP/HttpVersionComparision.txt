### **HTTP/0.9**
- **Introduced**: 1991
- **Key Features**:
  - Very basic protocol, only supported the `GET` method.
  - No headers, status codes, or metadata.
  - Designed for simple text-based communication.
- **Limitations**:
  - No support for modern web features like images, stylesheets, or scripts.

---

### **HTTP/1.0**
- **Introduced**: 1996
- **Key Features**:
  - Added support for headers and status codes.
  - Allowed more complex communication, including images and multimedia.
  - Each request required a new TCP connection.
- **Limitations**:
  - Inefficient due to the lack of persistent connections.

---

### **HTTP/1.1**
- **Introduced**: 1997
- **Key Features**:
  - Persistent connections (keep-alive) to reuse TCP connections.
  - Chunked transfer encoding for streaming data.
  - Added more HTTP methods like `PUT`, `DELETE`, and `OPTIONS`.
  - Improved caching mechanisms.
- **Limitations**:
  - Head-of-line blocking: Requests were processed sequentially, causing delays.

---

### **HTTP/2**
- **Introduced**: 2015
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiplexing: Multiple requests and responses can be sent simultaneously over a single connection.
  - Binary protocol (instead of text-based) for faster processing.
  - Header compression to reduce overhead.
  - Prioritization of requests.
- **Limitations**:
  - Still relies on TCP, which can cause latency issues due to packet loss.

---

### **HTTP/3**
- **Introduced**: 2020 (based on QUIC protocol)
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses QUIC (UDP-based) instead of TCP for faster and more reliable connections.
  - Eliminates head-of-line blocking at the transport layer.
  - Improved performance for mobile and high-latency networks.
  - Built-in encryption (TLS 1.3).
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster page loads and better handling of packet loss.
