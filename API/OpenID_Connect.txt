The OpenID protocol is an open standard and decentralized authentication system that allows users 
to log in to multiple websites using a single identity. Instead of creating separate usernames and 
passwords for each site, users authenticate through a trusted third-party identity provider (IDP), 
which verifies their identity and shares it with the website they want to access (known as the relying party).

### Key Features:
1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Users can log in to multiple websites with one set of credentials, simplifying the login process.
2. **Decentralized**: OpenID does not rely on a central authority; any entity can act as an identity provider.
3. **Flexibility**: It supports various authentication methods, from passwords to biometrics.
4. **User Control**: Users can choose which identity provider to use and what information to share with relying parties.

### How It Works:
1. A user selects an OpenID identity provider and logs in.
2. The identity provider authenticates the user and generates an identifier (a unique URI).
3. The user uses this identifier to log in to websites that support OpenID.
4. The relying party verifies the user's identity with the identity provider.

OpenID is widely used for simplifying authentication processes and enhancing user convenience.
