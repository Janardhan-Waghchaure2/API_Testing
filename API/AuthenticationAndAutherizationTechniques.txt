### Authentication Techniques:

1. Password-based/basic token authentication 
   -> id,pass/token is sent with every request to authenticate user.

2. Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
3. Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition)
4. Token-based authentication (JWT, OAuth)
5. Certificate-based authentication

6. API key auth: a key is sent by the API server and is sent on every request
   to server(as a header , query or path param of http request).

7. digest auth: digest auth uses cryptographic hashing to ensure that 
   credentials are not transmitted in an easily readable form.

8. Bearer Token Authentication:- user/client authenticates with an auth 
   server, and server issues a unique key/token to user/client. this token
   is sent in every request.

### Authorization Techniques:
1. Role-based access control (RBAC)
2. Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
3. Access control lists (ACLs)
4. Policy-based access control (PBAC)
5. JSON Web Token (JWT) authorization
