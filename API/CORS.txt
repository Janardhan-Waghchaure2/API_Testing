You're close, but let's clarify it a bit more. **CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different origin than the one that served the web page.

### Key Points about CORS:
1. **Same Origin Policy**: 
   - By default, web pages can only make requests to the same origin (same scheme, hostname, and port) that served them. This is called the Same Origin Policy.
   - Example: A web page served from `https://example.com:80` can make requests to the same origin but cannot make requests to `https://api.example.com:80`.

2. **Cross-Origin Requests**:
   - If a web page attempts to make a request to a different origin, this is considered a cross-origin request.
   - Example: A web page served from `https://example.com:80` attempts to make a request to `https://api.anotherdomain.com:80`.

3. **CORS Headers**:
   - To allow cross-origin requests, the server being accessed must include specific headers in the response indicating that the request is allowed.
   - Common CORS headers include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`, `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`, and `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`.

### Your Example:
- If two processes are running on different ports on the same physical machine (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` and `http://localhost:4000`), and a web page served from one process tries to make a request to the other, the browser will enforce CORS rules.
- To allow the request, the server on `http://localhost:4000` must include the appropriate CORS headers in its response.

### Example CORS Header:
```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
```

### Summary:
- **Same Origin Policy**: Restricts web pages to making requests only to the same origin that served them.
- **CORS**: Allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources using special headers.
- **Your Scenario**: Involves cross-origin requests even if the processes are on the same physical machine but different ports.
