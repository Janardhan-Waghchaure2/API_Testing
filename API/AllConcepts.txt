RestAssured library
Serialization/deserialization
POJO / Plain Old Java object.
What is Schema validation?
Why Schema validation needed?

--------
Request & Response specification:--

We use request and response specifications in RestAssured to simplify and 
standardize the setup of our API tests. These specifications help us avoid 
code duplication and make the tests cleaner and more maintainable.

Benefits of Using Request and Response Specifications:

1. Code Reusability: Define common request and response settings once and reuse them across multiple tests.

2. Clean Code: Keep your test code clean and easy to read by separating the common setup from the test logic.

3. Consistency: Ensure consistency in request and response configurations, 
   such as headers, authentication, and base URIs, across all tests.

4. Ease of Maintenance: Update the specifications in one place if any changes 
   are required, rather than modifying every test individually.

There are 2 types of fromats for API contract
	1. Json

Response Schema example
{
	"type": "object",
	"required": [
		"created",
		"orderId"
	],
	"properties": {
		"created": {
			"title": "Created", 
			"type": "boolean",
			"examples": [
				true , false
			],
			"default": false
		},
		"orderId": {
			"title": "Orderid", 
			"type": "string",
			"default": null,
			"examples": [
				"3euspx6ZgzT-N7EM4PN85"
			]
		}
	}
