The terms **form-data** and **multipart** are often used interchangeably, 
but they have specific differences when it comes to sending data, especially 
in HTTP requests:

### **1. Form-Data**
- **Definition**: Form-data is a specific encoding type (`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`) used to send key-value pairs, often from web forms.
- **Common Use**: It's mostly used for simple form submissions where data is sent as key-value pairs (e.g., text fields, checkboxes, or dropdowns).
- **Encoding**: 
  - For `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, keys and values are URL-encoded and sent in a single body.
  - For `multipart/form-data`, the data is divided into parts when there are files or binary data involved.
- **Example**:
  ```
  Content-Type: multipart/form-data
  Body:
  --boundary
  Content-Disposition: form-data; name="username"

  user123
  --boundary
  Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="example.txt"

  (file content)
  --boundary--
  ```

### **2. Multipart**
- **Definition**: Multipart is a broader mechanism used to send various types of data in parts (or sections) within a single HTTP request body. It is a type of form-data but supports more complex data, including files and binary content.
- **Common Use**: It's primarily used for uploading files (e.g., images, videos) along with form fields.
- **Structure**: The request body is divided into multiple parts, each with its own `Content-Type` and headers, separated by boundaries.
- **Example**: Multipart is typically used for file uploads via `Content-Type: multipart/form-data`.

### Key Differences:
| Aspect                | **Form-Data**                  | **Multipart**                         |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**           | Key-value pairs, simple forms  | More complex data (e.g., files)       |
| **Encoding**          | URL-encoded or multipart       | Multipart (always divided into parts) |
| **Use Case**          | Simple data (like text fields) | Binary data, file uploads + text      |
| **Example**           | Text-based data only           | Mix of text and files                 |

In summary:
- **Form-data** is typically used in web form submissions, and **multipart** is a specific subset that allows uploading files alongside form fields.
