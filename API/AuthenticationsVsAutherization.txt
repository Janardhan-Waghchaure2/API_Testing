Authentication and authorization are two fundamental concepts in the field of cybersecurity and access control, but they serve different purposes. Let's break down each concept:

### Authentication:
**Purpose**: To verify the identity of a user or entity.

1. **What It Involves**: 
   - Authentication is the process of confirming that someone or something is who or what they claim to be.
   - Typically involves verifying credentials such as username/password, biometrics, tokens, or other forms of ID.

2. **Common Methods**:
   - Password-based authentication (e.g., entering a username and password).
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) (e.g., password + OTP sent to a phone).
   - Biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition).
   - Token-based authentication (e.g., JWT tokens, OAuth tokens).

3. **Example**:
   - When you log into your email account with your username and password, you are authenticating your identity to the email service.

### Authorization:
**Purpose**: To determine what authenticated users are allowed to do.

1. **What It Involves**: 
   - Authorization is the process of granting or denying specific permissions to an authenticated user to access resources or perform actions.
   - It defines what an authenticated user can do, such as accessing certain data, performing specific tasks, or using particular functionalities.

2. **Common Methods**:
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) (e.g., assigning roles such as admin, editor, or viewer).
   - Attribute-based access control (ABAC) (e.g., granting permissions based on user attributes).
   - Policies and permissions (e.g., using access control lists or security policies).

3. **Example**:
   - After logging into your email account, authorization determines whether you can read, delete, or send emails, or access specific folders.

### Key Differences:
- **Authentication**: Focuses on verifying identity.
- **Authorization**: Focuses on granting permissions based on the verified identity.

### Summary:
- **Authentication**: Answers the question, "Who are you?"
- **Authorization**: Answers the question, "What can you do?"

Both processes work together to ensure secure access to resources. Authentication happens first to identify the user, followed by authorization to grant appropriate permissions based on the user's identity.



------------ analogy:
authentication : showing id on gate and passing through security.
                 i.e checking if you can enter into system.
                 done by the user/client.
autherization : trying to enter ODC building where we don't have access to.
                i.e checking if your having rights to enter into a specific
                 service/system.
                for gaining access we need to contact admin.

we first need to pass security gate BEFORE ENTERING INTO AN ODC module , 
i.e authentication comes first than autherization.
