The customer (you) makes a request to the waiter (API) by ordering a dish from the menu. 
The waiter (API) takes your request to the chef (server) in the kitchen (backend). 
The chef (server) prepares the dish (processes the request) and hands it back to the waiter (API), 
who then serves it to you. 
This process ensures you get your desired dish (response) without needing to interact directly with the kitchen (server).
