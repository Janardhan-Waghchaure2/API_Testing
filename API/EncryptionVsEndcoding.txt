Encryption and encoding are both processes used to transform data, 
but they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

### Encryption:
- **Purpose**: The primary goal of encryption is to protect data by making it unreadable to unauthorized users. 
               It ensures confidentiality and security.
- **Process**: Encryption algorithms use a key to convert plain text into ciphertext. Only those with the correct 
               decryption key can revert the ciphertext back to its original form.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in securing sensitive information such as passwords, 
             financial data, and personal communications.

### Encoding:
- **Purpose**: Encoding's main objective is to transform data into a different format for efficient 
               storage or transmission. It ensures data integrity and usability.
- **Process**: Encoding schemes, such as Base64 or URL encoding, convert data into a different format 
               without using a key. The process is reversible and doesn't involve any security measures.
- **Usage**: Commonly used in data representation, such as converting binary data to text for transmission 
             over media that only support text, or ensuring special characters are correctly transmitted in URLs.

**Summary**:
- **Encryption**: Focuses on security and requires a key for decryption.
- **Encoding**: Focuses on data transformation for compatibility and storage without security considerations.
