SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificates are used to establish a secure, encrypted connection between a client (e.g., a web browser) and a server (e.g., a website). Here's a high-level overview of how SSL certificates work:

### 1. **Certificate Authority (CA)**:
- **Issuance**: SSL certificates are issued by trusted organizations called Certificate Authorities (CAs). When a website owner requests an SSL certificate, the CA verifies the owner's identity and domain ownership.

### 2. **Public and Private Keys**:
- **Key Pair**: The SSL certificate contains a public key, while the server securely holds the corresponding private key. These keys are used for encryption and decryption.

### 3. **Handshake Process**:
- **Client Request**: When a client (e.g., a web browser) connects to a server over HTTPS, it requests a secure connection.
- **Server Response**: The server responds by sending its SSL certificate, which includes the public key and information about the CA that issued the certificate.
- **Verification**: The client verifies the certificate's authenticity by checking it against the list of trusted CAs and ensuring it hasn't expired or been revoked.

### 4. **Session Key Exchange**:
- **Encryption**: Once the certificate is verified, the client and server use the public key to securely exchange a session key. This session key is a symmetric key used for encrypting data during the session.
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Symmetric encryption is used for the actual data transmission because it's faster than asymmetric encryption.

### 5. **Secure Communication**:
- **Encrypted Data**: All data exchanged between the client and server is encrypted using the session key. This ensures that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot read it without the key.
- **Decryption**: The server and client use the session key to decrypt the data received from each other.

### Summary:
- **SSL Certificates**: Issued by Certificate Authorities to verify the identity of websites.
- **Public and Private Keys**: Used for encryption and decryption.
- **Handshake Process**: Establishes a secure connection by verifying the certificate and exchanging a session key.
- **Secure Communication**: Ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and secure.

   |                        |
   |  --- Hello (Client) -->|
   |                        |
   |<--- Certificate (Server)|
   |                        |
   |  --- Verify (Client) -->|
   |                        |
   |  --- Session Key (Client) (Encrypted with Server's Public Key) --->
   |                        |
   |                        |
   |<-- Encrypted Data --|
   |                        |
   |--> Encrypted Data -->|
