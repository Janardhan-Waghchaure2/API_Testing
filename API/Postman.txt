While Postman is indeed a popular tool for manual testing of APIs, it's not limited to manual testing use case. 
Postman offers a variety of features that make it suitable for automated testing, documentation, and more:

### Manual Testing:
- **Send Requests**: Easily create and send HTTP requests to test APIs.
- **Inspect Responses**: View and analyze the responses from the server.
- **Save Requests**: Save requests and organize them into collections for reuse.

### Automated Testing:
- **Test Scripts**: Write pre-request and test scripts using JavaScript to automate testing.
- **Collection Runner**: Run a collection of requests in sequence and automate tests.
- **Newman**: Use Postman's command-line tool, Newman, to run collections and scripts as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

### Documentation:
- **Generate Documentation**: Automatically generate API documentation from your collections.
- **Publish**: Publish the documentation to a public or private URL for easy sharing.

### Mock Servers:
- **Create Mock Servers**: Set up mock servers to simulate API responses and test without relying on the actual API.

### Monitoring:
- **API Monitoring**: Schedule and monitor API requests to ensure uptime and performance.

### Collaboration:
- **Team Workspaces**: Share collections and collaborate with team members in real-time.

Postman is a versatile tool that goes beyond manual testing, supporting a wide range of API development and testing workflows.
